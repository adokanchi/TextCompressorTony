| Dec 4   | 12:40-1:40 |  Discussions about potential approaches---something about detecting common sequences of characters (" the " and things like that), potentially by taking a sample of the beginning of the text, and taking advantage of that redundancy? The exact approach is still in question. |
| Dec 6   | 9:15-9:45  | Built the code to store the first 100 words (without spaces) in an array. Created an int-char map with 75 characters used commonly in text. Using 7-bit codes with 128 possibilities, that gives space for 53 stored words. If 8-bit codes were used, this could increase to 181. |
