| April 5 |     9-10pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Dec 4   |   12:40-1:40    |                                                                         Discussions about potential approaches---something about detecting common sequences of characters (" the " and things like that), potentially by taking a sample of the beginning of the text, and taking advantage of that redundancy? The exact approach is still in question. |
| Dec 6   |    9:15-9:45    |                                                                        Built the code to store the first 100 words (without spaces) in an array. Created an int-char map with 75 characters used commonly in text. Using 7-bit codes with 128 possibilities, that gives space for 53 stored words. If 8-bit codes were used, this could increase to 181. |
| Dec 6   |   10:00-10:40   |                                                                            Built a mix of code and pseudocode that would apply the compression. It seems like it would be really really slow to compress, but I don't see any other way to do something like this. It's also really (probably unnecessarily) complicated, but I don't see a simpler way. |
| Dec 10  |   8:45-9:15am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In-class discussion about edge cases |
| Dec 10  |   9:20-9:55am   |                                                                                                                                       Began coding LZW Compression. I think what I have should work in theory (aside from the edge case), but I'm still in the process of verifying it. I'm pretty much just translating the pseudocode from the slides. |
| Dec 10  | 10:00am-10:40am | I finished coding compress() (aside from the edge case) and expand(). I don't have time to test them at the moment. They probably don't work, but I don't see any obvious issues, so there's a small chance they do. I did a small example for compress() on my iPad manually, and it seems like the code should work, but we'll see what the tests say. |
| Dec 11  |    2-2:55pm     |              Tried fixing expand() by nuking my code and redoing it all. I have no idea why I'm getting the issues I am---my best guess is my program is reading in multiple bits at a time and trying to interpret them as text instead of as a bit string, which throws off parseint()? I have to do more testing to figure out why this is happening. |
