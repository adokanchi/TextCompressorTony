| Dec 4     |   12:40-1:40    |                                                                                                                                                                      Discussions about potential approaches---something about detecting common sequences of characters (" the " and things like that), potentially by taking a sample of the beginning of the text, and taking advantage of that redundancy? The exact approach is still in question. |
| Dec 6     |    9:15-9:45    |                                                                                                                                                                     Built the code to store the first 100 words (without spaces) in an array. Created an int-char map with 75 characters used commonly in text. Using 7-bit codes with 128 possibilities, that gives space for 53 stored words. If 8-bit codes were used, this could increase to 181. |
| Dec 6     |   10:00-10:40   |                                                                                                                                                                         Built a mix of code and pseudocode that would apply the compression. It seems like it would be really really slow to compress, but I don't see any other way to do something like this. It's also really (probably unnecessarily) complicated, but I don't see a simpler way. |

| Dec 10    |   9:20-9:55am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Began coding LZW Compression. I think what I have should work in theory (aside from the edge case), but I'm still in the process of verifying it. I'm pretty much just translating the pseudocode from the slides. |
| Dec 10    |  10:00-10:40am  |                                                                                              I finished coding compress() (aside from the edge case) and expand(). I don't have time to test them at the moment. They probably don't work, but I don't see any obvious issues, so there's a small chance they do. I did a small example for compress() on my iPad manually, and it seems like the code should work, but we'll see what the tests say. |
| Dec 11    |    2-2:55pm     |                                                                                                           Tried fixing expand() by nuking my code and redoing it all. I have no idea why I'm getting the issues I am---my best guess is my program is reading in multiple bits at a time and trying to interpret them as text instead of as a bit string, which throws off parseint()? I have to do more testing to figure out why this is happening. |
| Dec 12    |  12:30-1:10am   | Completely rewrote the main loop for expand() again (im getting tired of doing that) because it wasn't making sense in my head because I didn't understand the algorithm well enough when I coded it initally. I think what I have now should work? But I also think my compress() method is wrong so I can't test it (and compress() has some substring() calls in anyways which I have to remove, so even if this worked I still wouldn't be done). |
| Dec 13    |  12:00-12:30am  |         Having an issue with Integer.parseInt() where it's trying to read in an empty string for some reason. I can't figure out why---for some reasong charAt() is returning an empty string or something? I can't figure out how to diagnose this error. compress() is running without errors, but IDK if it's working properly or not, as I've been focusing on trying to get expand() running without errors before troubleshooting logic issues. |
| Dec 20-21 | 11:45pm-12:45am |                                                                                                                                        I grabbed a blank copy of the repo and just decided to recode everything from the ground up. It seems like everything works now, including the edge case. I'm getting a compression ratio of 45.7% on shakespeare.txt. I have no clue why I was getting these weird bugs but they're gone so I'm fine with it. |
